## Autocorrelation and duration of unfavorable events
- Strong autocorrelation: prolonged exposure to temperatures above or below the average
- Changes how temperatures are organized across time
- Solid and dashed lines: unique thermal regimes with same average temperature
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/user/Desktop/figures_autocorrelation/thermal_regimes.jpeg")

#- Autocorrelation is the dependency of a given measurement (eg., temperature) across time
#- Example: if it was cold yesterday, there is a greater probability that today will also be cold
#- Autocorrelation is calculated after detrending dataset (removing upward or downward linear tendency)
#- Autocorrelation refers to errors of linear regression (lack of independence of errors); errors refer to distance from the average temperature
#- Autocorrelation changes how temperatures are organized across time (eg., solid lines are the same temperatures organized differently across time)
#- Solid and dashed lines represent 2 thermal regimes with the same average temperature (27 ºC), each was used in a given experimental run
```

## Thermal performance curves
- Model selection: AICc score to choose model that best describes data
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/user/Desktop/figures_autocorrelation/tpc_fits.jpeg")
#  likelihood of a given model is proportional to the probability of obtaining the data given the model
# maximum likelihood estimate.: parameter(s) values that make the likelihood of our model as large as possible
# comparing models: the best has the lowest negative log-likelihood
# AIC approach: higher scores for models with higher likelihoods, and models with fewer parameters.
# AICc corrects for small samples
# Akaike weights: the probability that a given model is the best one, given the data and the set of candidate models (differences in AIC with respect to the AIC of the best candidate model; model likelihoods are divided by the sum of the likelihoods of all models)
```

## Frequency distribution of performance
H1: Away from optimal temperatures, frequency distribution of performance is bimodal in the strong autocorrelation treatment and unimodal in the no autocorrelation treatment  
Expectations for the strong autocorrelation treatment:
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}

```

## H2: Timing of exposures
In relation to randomly varying control:  
* Below optimal: cold start decreases performance  
* Around optimal: no differences   
* Above optimal: hot start decreases performance  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/user/Desktop/figures_autocorrelation/hypothesis2.png")
# reasoning for absence of effects: hot-cold in low temps & cold-hot in high temps:
# a "good" start will be only slightly more beneficial than average temperature, not enough to be significant (especially because organisms will be exposed to "bad" conditions in the second half of the experiment)
# reasoning for expecting effects: cold-hot in low temps & hot-cold in high temps:
# a "bad" start will impact performance right away, and this is not reversible, even when conditions get better later on (this is related to maldaptation - lack of acclimation and exposure to extremes)
```

## Survival
H3: A hot start will impact survival when average temperatures are hot

## Results
H1: Strong autocorrelation changes frequency distribution of performance away from optimal
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
# RGR: increase in parameter (reproduction = frond number/count) per day (time unit of 1 day)
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/user/Desktop/figures_autocorrelation/h1_histogram1.jpg")
```

## Closer look at 37 ºC results
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
# RGR: increase in parameter (reproduction = frond number/count) per day (time unit of 1 day)
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/user/Desktop/figures_autocorrelation/h1_histogram2.jpg")
```

## H2: Does the timing of unfavorable conditions matter?
Reproduction: frond counts; Growth: surface area (cm²)

$$RGR=\frac{log(measurement_{end})-log(measurement_{start})}{time_{end} - time_{start}}$$

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
# RGR: increase in parameter (reproduction = frond number/count) per day (time unit of 1 day)

```

## H3: Suvival impacts of a hot start
- Individual counts
- Binary categorization of fronds: 1 = living; 0 = dead
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/user/Desktop/figures_autocorrelation/h3_1.png")
```

## H3: Suvival analysis
