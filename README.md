Thermal Experiments – Cuddington Lab

This repository contains datasets, incubator documents, and code from experiments conducted in the Cuddington Lab to study temperature responses of ectotherms, including duckweeds and aphids. The experiments include both controlled laboratory studies using LED incubators and greenhouse-based experiments.

Autocorrelation experiment datasets: for all datasets below, the categorization of thermal sequences into negative or positive was based on a linear regression of the entire strong autocorrelation sequence (120 or 240h)
- autocorrelation_TPC.csv:
  Cleaned dataset from autocorrelation experiments using common duckweeds. Used to generate thermal performance curves for replicates exposed to different levels of temporal autocorrelation.

- dataset_autocorrelation_2021-2022.csv:
  Full dataset covering 5-day experiments with both aphids and duckweeds conducted during the 2021–2022 period; duckweed experiments did not include first-daughter separation procedure.

- dataset_autocorrelation_2022-2023.csv:
  Full dataset for 5-day duckweed experiments conducted during the 2022–2023 period; experiments included repeated first-daughter separation procedure. 

- dataset_autocorrelation_2024_10d.csv:
  Full dataset for duckweed experiments conducted in 2024 with a 10-day experimental design, including repeated first-daughter separation procedure.

- dataset_autocorrelation_2025.csv: Dataset for aphid experiments conducted in 2025.
