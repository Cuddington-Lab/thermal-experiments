Thermal Experiments – Cuddington Lab

This repository contains datasets, incubator documents, and code from experiments conducted in the Cuddington Lab to study temperature responses of ectotherms, including duckweeds and aphids. The experiments include both controlled laboratory studies using LED incubators and greenhouse-based experiments.

Datasets:
- autocorrelation_TPC.csv:
  Cleaned dataset from autocorrelation experiments using common duckweeds. Used to generate thermal performance curves for replicates exposed to different levels of temporal autocorrelation.

- dataset_autocorrelation_2021-2022.csv:
  Full dataset covering experiments with both aphids and duckweeds conducted during the 2021–2022 period.

- dataset_autocorrelation_2022-2023.csv:
  Full dataset for duckweed experiments conducted during the 2022–2023 period.

- dataset_autocorrelation_2024_10d.csv:
  Full dataset for duckweed experiments conducted in 2024 with a 10-day experimental design.
