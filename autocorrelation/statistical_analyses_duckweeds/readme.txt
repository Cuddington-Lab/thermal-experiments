Statistical Analyses â€“ Duckweed Temporal Autocorrelation Experiments

This project contains statistical analyses for experiments investigating temporal autocorrelation in duckweed populations, focusing on population growth.

Folder: autocorrelation/statistical_analyses_duckweeds

Project Purpose:
The goal is to analyze how temporal autocorrelation affects duckweed population growth. 

Contents:
- .Rmd files: R Markdown files containing all the code used for each statistical analysis, with comments explaining each step.
- .pdf files: Rendered outputs of the .Rmd files, including summaries of statistical results and graphs.

Methods Overview:
The analyses include comparisons across temperature treatments, evaluation of autocorrelation effects, and visualization of growth trends and statistical summaries.
